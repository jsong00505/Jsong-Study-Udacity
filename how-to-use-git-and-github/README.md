# UDACITY How to Use Git and GitHub

This class was about how to use Git and GitHub. I had a good time for that because I knew how to use a little bit, but not many. I still need to study more about how to use, but I can say how to use Git right now in confidence.

You just check out what I have done [here](docs/README.md)
