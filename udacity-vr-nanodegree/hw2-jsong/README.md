# My Shiny Apartment

## Summary
Do you wanna build an apartment? This apartment is one of June's VR place. Everything is static there, but not globe. That is because of "and yet it still moves" said Galileo. So if you interact with the world, the globe will spin. Hope to enjoy the world, and just follow below instructions to build this app.

### 1) Who am I?
* NAME: Jun Song

### 2) How long did you take to make?
* Almost 3 hours took

### 3) Challenge
* I was confused about how to make the globe spin. That is because it didn't work well. You could check my problem was [here](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/spinning-globe-not-stopping-after-click/196334/28?u=june_622016308842413).
* The globe spin was the hardest challenge to me.

## Environment
* Unity 5.4.2
* Windows 10

I am using Unity 5.4.2. If your Unity is higher and lower, this project would not be working.
However, I just covered common stuff, so I think it would work properly.

## Folder
* Assets: Assets of this project. I deleted Plugin and GoogleVR folder, so you might need to those plugins.
* Build: APK file I built.
* ProjectSettings: Setting files.
* Screenshots: Screenshots I took.
