## 1. Waypoints
** GOAL **
- Add additional Waypoints
- Change the way they look
- Change how quickly we move to a new waypoint when we click it

### Practice1
1. Go to `island` scene
2. Go to `Art` -> `Prefabs` -> `Systems`
3. Drag-and-drop `Waypoints` into the scene
4. Reset the position
5. Move toward to island
6. See 2 scripts called `Waypoint` and `Navigate` on the root node
7. Modify the scripts and let's start with `Waypoint` first
8. Chage `animation_scale` to `3.0f` and see what happens
9. Nothing changed because Unity allows us to change public variables in the inspector and override those values in scripts so need to set them in the inspector itself.
10. See animator a lot of quicker
11. Change `Animation_speed` 2 by adjusting speed
12. See pulsating is bigger and slower
13. Go to `Navigation` script and look around
14. Drag-and-drop `Waypoint` into the scene to add new waypoint
15. Position it and need to set the waypoint neighbors
16. Drag one `Waypoint` property to Element of Neighborhood

## 2. Ocean Shader
