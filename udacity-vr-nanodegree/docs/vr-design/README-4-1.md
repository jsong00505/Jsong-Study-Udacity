## Post your notes Quiz - VR Roller Coaster

This VR Roller Coaster app made me feel to ride a roller coaster like a real. I enjoyed the attraction and I have heard one of Korean amusement park called `Lotte World` would provide VR attraction like this app. Someday I want to experience that.

Anyway, this app is cool for real.
