[<- Previous](README-4-2.md) ..... [Next ->](README-4-4.md)

## Establishing Scale
- Find anything from real-world
- Use door object

## User Testing - Goals

- Goals help get information

## How do we define a goal?

- Scale
- Lighting
- Distance
- Comfort

## What questions do we want answered?

- Does the scale feel appropriate?
- Is our experience comfortable?
- Is the mood well established?

## Questions in user testing

- Asking leading questions
- Asking dead-end questions

## Asking leading questions

- NO: "Do you think the mood is magical?"
- YES!: "Can you describe the mood?"

## Asking dead-end questions

- No: "Did you enjoy the experience?"
- YES!: "Tell me about your experience"

## Follow up!

- Don't be afraid to be improvisational during the user interview!
- Write your questions down beforehand and bring them!

## How many people do we test with?

- After **just 5 users**, you reach the point of diminishing returns
- For our purposes, we won't even need five.
- Ideally, you can get at least two users per test.
- One is better than none!

## Record your test!

- Video is a great way to record user testing.
- Mobile VR is particularly difficult to screen capture from.
- Make sure to take notes!
- ...and make sure your notes are as detailed as possible.
- Let's give it a shot!

**One is better than none!**
