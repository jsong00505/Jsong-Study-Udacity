# Brand-New June's Hello VR World

## Summary
This is my frist VR project of Udacity called "Brand-New June's Hello VR World". This is about chaging cubes by VR app. You can play around in VR world. It is one of the most fatastic experience you ever had before. The best part of the world is spawning the cubes from the sky. It looks like a real one. Hope to enjoy the world, and just follow below instructions to build this app.
