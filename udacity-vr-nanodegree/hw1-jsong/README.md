# My First VR Project

## Summary
This is my frist VR project of Udacity. This is about chaging cubes by VR app. Just follow below instruction to build this app.

## Requirement
* Unity 5.4.2

I am using Unity 5.4.2. If your Unity is higher and lower, this project would not be working.
However, I just covered common stuff, so I think it would work properly.

## Folder
* Assets: Assets of this project. I deleted Plugin and GoogleVR folder, so you might need to those plugins.
* Build: APK file I built.
* ProjectSettings: Setting files.
* Screenshot: Screenshots I took.
