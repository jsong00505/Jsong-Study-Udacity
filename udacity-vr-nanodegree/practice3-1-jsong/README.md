# SCRIPT

## BEHAVIORS

`Example`

A dog object might have:
* "bark" behavior
* "walk around" behavior
* "love humans" behavior


## MAJOR ELEMENTS
1. Start()
This contains all the instructions you need to happen when you first load the scene

2. Update()
This contains all the instructions for when this behavior actually happen

## What I did for the practice

1. Created new project named "practice3-1-jsong"

2. Made new behavior called "MyFirstBehavior"

3. Just looked around the script.
