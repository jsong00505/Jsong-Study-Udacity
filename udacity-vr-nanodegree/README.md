# UDACITY VR Developer Nanodegree

Virtual Reality(a.k.a VR) is the one of the most promising area at IT industry. I think VR, AR(Augmented Reality) and MR(Mergied Reality) will be common in the future. If so, we don't have to go outside to work or do someting.
I believe in this technology will help people a lot, and that is why I am studying.
